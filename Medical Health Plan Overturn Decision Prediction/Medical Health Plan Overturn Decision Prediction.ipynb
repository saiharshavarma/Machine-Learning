      " A 19-year-old male enrollee has requested for reinduction chemotherapy and haplo-compatible T-cell-depleted transplant with multiple post-transplant donor lymphocyte infusions for treatment of his acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Findings:  The physician reviewer found that there is extensive research in this area at the present time, and the results are promising. For a patient such as this patient, transplant with multiple DLIs is the only potentially curative treatment alternative, and may be effective even in the face of aggressive AML.

      " A 24-year-old male enrollee requested residential treatment center services for medical treatment of his bipolar disorder and substance abuse.  Findings:  The physician reviewer found that this patient did not meet the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) criteria for residential substance abuse treatment. The records indicate the patient did not meet criteria of moderate withdrawal and had no co-occurring biomedical conditions. The patient had ceased using all substances one month prior to admission, except for alcohol which was not consumed daily. In addition, the patient demonstrated readiness to change according to the admitting psychiatrist. Further, the provider noted the patient did not have any documented impairment in social functioning, self-care, or a history suggestive of destabilization without residential treatment. Therefore, the residential substance abuse treatment services were not medically necessary for treatment of this patient’s medical condition.

      " A 27-year-old male has requested Cymbalta 60mg, two capsules per day for treatment of his joint pain.  Findings:  The physician reviewer found that Cymbalta (Duloxetine) is medically necessary treatment for the patient’s medical condition. The patient has tried and failed to benefit from standard therapy. Additionally, the patient’s medical condition is both chronic and seriously debilitating. Cymbalta is supported in the peer–review medical literature as a safe and effective treatment for combined disorders of chronic joint pain and depression.A study by Citrome, et al. examined the use of Duloxetine for the treatment of osteoarthritic pain. The authors reported that Duloxetine received FDA approval in 2010 for the indication of chronic musculoskeletal pain, including osteoarthritis. The authors concluded that the new data supports the application of Duloxetine for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Skljareviski and colleagues performed a randomized double blind placebo controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of Duloxetine in patients with chronic low back pain. The authors found that “Duloxetine treated patients reported greater reduction in pain than  the placebo-controlled group” and concluded that the data demonstrates the efficacy and safety of Duloxetine in the treatment of chronic low back pain. The authors also reported that Duloxetine received approval for treatment of chronic low back pain in 2010. In sum, the requested medication is medically necessary to treat the patient’s medical condition.

      " A 39-year-old male enrollee has requested the ClariVein procedure for treatment of his medical condition. Findings:  Two physician reviewers found that review of the submitted clinical documentation does not demonstrate that the services are likely to be of greater benefit to this patient than conservative treatment options.  Per the submitted documentation, the patient does not appear to have complaints related to superficial venous incompetence.  The records indicate that the patient is asymptomatic and has no sequelae of venous insufficiency.  Additionally, the treatment notes do not document prior conservative therapy.  Thus, there is a lack of support for the requested services in this clinical setting. Absent documentation of symptomatology that has failed to respond to conservative treatment, the patient is not an appropriate candidate for the ClariVein procedure at this time.

      " A 41-year-old male enrollee has requested for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy for TMS therapy for treatment of his major depressive disorder and mood disorder not otherwise specified (NOS). Findings:  Two physician reviewers found that the FDA has approved TMS as a specific treatment for severe depression and has developed guidelines for its use. Additionally, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) included TMS in their 2010 guidelines as an appropriate acute phase treatment option for patients who do not respond adequately to medication therapy. Further, the American Medical Association (AMA) has approved Category I CPT codes for TMS effective in January 2011. The attending physician states in her documents that ECT was seriously considered and rejected because of its inherent side effects. Specifically, she does not feel that the patient could tolerate either the anesthesia or the invasive nature of the procedure itself. Several of the above cited articles show that TMS compares favorably with ECT. Grunhaus and colleagues reported that their conclusion is “particularly relevant because it suggests that rTMS and ECT reach similar results in nonpsychotic major depressive disorder.” Similarly, Eranti and colleagues noted that although ECT was more effective in the short term, “at 6 months the HAM-D scores did not differ between groups. Self- and observer-rated cognitive measures were similar in the two groups.”  The patient has already had a positive result from TMS, which was a reasonable alternative to ECT in this case.Thus, all told the TMS therapy at issue was and is likely to be more beneficial than other standard therapies available for treatment of this patient’s medical condition.

      "This patient is morbidly obese and has back pain. Although the surgeon’s consultation describes neck and shoulder pain, these symptoms are not evident in the primary care physician’s (PCP) notes. The PCP note dated February 2006 only describes low back pain that could be secondary to obesity.  The patient has requested authorization and coverage for bilateral reduction mammaplasty with the anticipated removal of 350 grams of tissue from each breast. The Health Plan has denied this request on the basis that the proposed procedure is not medically necessary.A breast reduction is not established to be medically necessary for this patient because her symptoms are not completely consistent with a diagnosis of symptomatic macromastia. The medical literature indicates that symptom presentation is the most important factor in diagnosing symptomatic macromastia. According to an article by Gonzalez, et. al., symptomatic macromastia is best defined as a pain complex in three or more anatomic areas. The incidence and severity of headache, neck pain, shoulder pain, back pain, breast pain and painful bra strap grooves in this group of patients are greater by 3 standard deviations than in a control population matched for age. The PCP notes only describe symptoms in one area (back pain), and obesity is a common cause of back pain.Furthermore, studies indicate that patients with symptomatic macromastia have a typical constellation of musculoskeletal symptoms involving the upper torso, neck, arms and head.  The only musculoskeletal complaint documented in the PCP notes for this patient is back pain.  It is unclear why the surgeon’s consultation note describes neck and shoulder pain, as these symptoms are not documented in any of the PCP notes. Her symptoms as described in the PCP notes do not meet medical necessity criteria. In addition, due to the small volume to be resected, medical necessity for the breast reduction cannot be established.  This patient has atypical symptoms for symptomatic macromastia, and attempts at conservative care are not well documented.  Moreover, photographs show breast enlargement that is consistent with her obesity. The patient does not meet the guidelines for a diagnosis of symptomatic macromastia.Based upon the information set forth above, I have determined the requested procedure is not medically necessary for treatment of the patient’s medical condition. The Health Plan’s denial should be upheld.

      "This patient is now a 33-year-old female who has end stage renal disease, mild hypertension and a kidney transplant with rejection requiring her to go back on dialysis. She failed home peritoneal dialysis because of peritonitis. She is now medically stable on three-times-per-week hemodialysis. The patient wishes to dialyze at home. The Health Plan indicates home hemodialysis is not medically necessary for this patient.There is no description of a medical necessity, which would require this patient to dialyze at home. It is stated that she wishes to dialyze daily as opposed to the current three-times-per-week schedule. The medical justification for this is not clear, but common reasons for such a schedule are severe congestive heart failure, intractable hyperphosphatemia or uncontrolled hypertension. No medical evidence has been provided that would place this patient in the category of patients needing more than three-times-a-week dialysis. It is possible the patient wishes to dialyze at home for convenience.  The standard of care at this point is center-based dialysis, where the patient can be observed carefully and her dialysis regime can be adjusted under strict medical supervision.  Therefore, I have determined the requested home hemodialysis is not medically necessary for treatment of the patient’s medical condition.

      "Twenty-three year-old female patient has been diagnosed with severe, recurrent, major depression starting at the age of 11 to 12 years and has been treated with numerous medications, as well as psychotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy. She has been admitted to inpatient psychiatric care a number of times. In spite of all these interventions, her symptoms of depression have continued. The patient reportedly has decreased activity, increased sleep, poor concentration, social isolation, decreased appetite, irritable mood, suicidal ideation and self-injurious behaviors.  Reviewers’ Findings:  The reviewing physicians concluded that the psychiatric community at large has not yet embraced VNS therapy as part of the national standard of care for severe depression. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has gone on record in stating, “While VNS therapy has been studied over the past five years, evidence is not yet sufficient to recommend its use in routine clinical care.” VNS therapy is not, at this time, included in the APA treatment guidelines for major depression. That said, it is very likely a future iteration of the guidelines will include a recommendation regarding the use of VNS therapy for carefully selected patient and provide a stringent protocol-driven selection process. Clinical and preclinical research with VNS therapy is ongoing and when sufficient data is accumulated the role of VNS therapy in the treatment of depression will become clearer. Until that time recommendations for its use for patients such as this one are premature. Therefore, the reviewers found that the Health Plan denial should be upheld.

Findings: The physician reviewer found that chronic pain that is unable to be cured can be considered palliative in nature and treatment. The step wise World Health Organization (WHO) ladder for pain relief is considered the reasonable approach to pain control in the palliative setting. In this patient, the submitted records do not indicate that all non-opioid treatment options have been utilized nor does the documentation indicate an optimization of all non-opioid medications.  Rather, quite large doses of opioids are being used despite research to show the dangers of a high dose and its lack of efficacy as it impacts quality of life.  The submitted records do not show that this patient has participated in behavior therapy despite much research supporting its use. The records reflect that tolerance has taken place as indicated by the use of narcotics and dose escalation which differs from the original plan by the physician who started the OxyContin.  Dose escalation is not a long term plan but a short term plan for the treatment of tolerance. The addition of more pure mu agonists will, for a short while, take care of the symptoms of mu agonist saturation; however, down regulation will transpire and then the patient is only back to where they started in terms of their pain perception. Studies reveal that such patients are worse off since they now have a much higher opioid tolerance level.  Additionally, there are other non-pure mu agonists that have long lasting duration that do not appear to have been considered based on the records provided. Further, there is no plan in place to monitor this patient with the medications both historically and currently. The documentation does not discuss other standard sarcoidosis treatments since the original notation.  Finally, multiple minimal requirements for opioid prescribing have not been met and the need to use them as the primary treatment strategy for pain has not been established. For all these reasons, the request of OxyContin is not medically necessary for treatment of the patient’s medical condition.  Final Result: The reviewer determined that the requested medication is not medically necessary for treatment of the patient’s medical condition. Therefore, the Health Plan’s denial should be upheld.  Credentials/Qualifications: The reviewer is board certified in anesthesiology with sub-specialty certification in pain medicine and is actively practicing. The reviewer is an expert in the treatment of the enrollee’s medical condition and knowledgeable about the proposed treatment through recent or current actual clinical experience treating those with the same or a similar medical condition.

      "female enrollee requested lymphedema drainage therapy with the use of low-level laser instrument LTU 904 for medical treatment of her postmastectomy lymphedema syndrome. Findings:  Two physician reviewers found that treatment of lymphedema typically involves some combination of manual treatment, pressure garments, and elevation. Smoot and colleagues reported that “low-level laser therapy is more effective in decreasing swelling but not pain, when compared to treatments that did include low-level laser therapy”. Further, this patient’s treatment has included low-level laser therapy with superior results compared to other available therapies. Thus, low-level laser therapy is likely to be more beneficial for treatment of the patient’s medical condition than any available standard therapy.
